## note one - ways to use md
normaly we put a "#" before words for a title , "##" before a mainpoint and "*" before a list component in a list , to put in plain words , we just create a new line and type words into it.
*# for a link we use the following format

## note two - ways to use terminal in linux
*# press ctrl + alt + t to open terminal at Home of your user.
*## cd
+ ~ to go back to user dir 
press tab to fill in automatically according to what is already typed in
mind that there's two situation when tab is pressed
	1. no conflicts occurs , fill in complished
	2. conflicts occurs , nothing happens . If tab pressed a second time , all possible dirs appears with thier names,
ls: show components in this dir
type nothing after cd goes back to ~(Home)
not only / means the root which can be used as a standard when getting into dirs , the ~ which means Home can also be used this way
*## mkdir
+ dirname to make this dir here
+ (-p) + dirname/dirname/dirname to make dirname/dirname/dirname here
+ dirname dirname dirname to make dirname dirname and dirname here
*## touch
used almost the same way as mkdir
*## gedit
+ filename to open filename using gedit
*## man
+ codename to show the usages of the code
* #mind that the home case in the computer dir is the dir which contains the user dirs , not the Hone dir which the terminal opens with default settings when you have only one user.
